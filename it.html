    <h2 style="color: #60ffff; position: absolute; top: 150px; left: 635px; text-align: center; font-family: fantasy;">So... Why IT?</h2>
    <p style="color: White; position: absolute; top: 400px; left: 265px; font-family: serif; font-size: 18px; text-align: left;">
      Technology has been always been quite a major part of my life, solving even the littlest of problems and innovating new ways of thinking <br> and connecting with people. From the original Ipad, I always wondered what limits (if there even were any) could be broken with IT, and <br> these days, advancing new technologies have far surpassed even our wildest imagination with the amount of connection and solutions it <br> generates. This curiosity towards technology I have had since I was a child, as I felt, and still feel to this day, that I understood computers <br> more than I did people, I found them more relatable and comprehendable, and thus I experimented with apps and games whenever I had a <br> chance. At the start of high school I got my first computer, a Mac, and always spent bits of time experimenting with apps and writing code <br> to keep my brain entertained. As I grew older, there was less time for playing around, but still carried a love for technology, and thus, I <br> persued many tech-based classes in VCE, where I learnt about many aspects of Data Analytics and Computing. I found that programming <br> in Computing was a enjoyment to me, so I saught out universities which could offer me the opportunity to learn how to properly program <br> in a business setting, and teach valuable skills for later on in a career/life itself. In regard of what I wish to pursue, I am still coming to <br> terms of exactly the field I want to follow, although I hope to go down a path where I may be able to help people who need technological <br> solutions and also be able to help tell stories through a technological medium, like through a game, to perhaps encourage a different way <br> of thinking.

    <p style="color: White; position: absolute; top: 800px; left: 265px; font-family: serif; font-size: 18px; text-align: left;">
      I chose to come to RMIT thanks to the flexibility and versatility that the IT course operates on, having very flexible elective options, <br> programming courses and more, with outlooks on a business side also. As well as being well recognised for it's technology courses, RMIT <br> was a excellent option for studying this particular bachelor, thanks to it's openness and flexibility, even in these strange semi-not-really-<br>normal COVID recovery times, which suited my schedule quite well. <br> In these studies, I wish to gain knowledge and experience in most of IT's fields, and see which one I'd like to specifically pursue, while <br> also diving into bigger IT concepts and how to apply them in a business for later
