    <h2 style="color: #60ffff; position: absolute; top: 150px; left: 680px; text-align: center; font-family: fantasy;">Ideal Job</h2>
    <h3 style="color: #20ffff; position: absolute; top: 250px; left: 950px; text-align: center; font-family: serif;"> Description </h3>
    <img src="images/jobAd.png" alt="Job Advertisement for Software Development" style="position: absolute; width: 500px; length: 500px; top: 300px; left: 260px">
    <h3 style="color: #20ffff; position: absolute; top: 580px; left: 900px; text-align: center; font-family: serif;"> Skills and Qualifications  </h3>
    <p style ="color: White; position: absolute; top: 300px; left: 765px; font-family: serif; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;"> Being a software developer means that you are responsible for creating, <br> testing and updating programs and their respective software for clients. This <br> specific job calls for both front and back end development, which includes <br> programming the logic in the parts 'behind the scenes' of the program, while <br> also developing and designing the User Interface for the solution. This job is <br> appealing to me as it combines both ends of programming and design, while <br> also creating solutions for everyday problems. With such a scope, one can <br> design a well-developed experience for users on both sides of the 'screen' <br> per-sei. Having arms into both programming and design allows more creative <br> thinking and innovation, and thought processes alongside how a program <br> could run, which grants opportunities to adaptively problem solve, create and <br> innovate on the go, while interacting with clients, and fullfilling their needs. <br> I feel as if my personality and talents would suit well into this position in the <br> future, and thus, I see it as a great, ideal and opportunistic job that I can aim <br> for, post-graduation.
    </p>
    <p style ="color: White; position: absolute; top: 620px; left: 765px; font-family: serif; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;"> Skills that are recommended for this job revolve around both programming <br> and technological frameworks knowledge, a supportive, friendly, authentic <br> personality who is both open minded and curious, as well as being well <br> mannered in communication. I believe that I obtain most of these skills to <br> date, except knowledge in the specific languages and technolgical <br> processes listed, as well as personal trouble with outward communication. I <br> know, however, that I can work on these skills in the following years, during <br> my university education, to target learning programming and technological <br> foundations, as well as connecting with new people and building better social <br> skills. To get into this type of job, I require finishing my studies, and then <br> gaining at least a year experience in a development role, which could be done <br> through an internship post-graduation.
    </p>
    <h3 style="color: #20ffff; position: absolute; top: 870px; left: 734px; text-align: center; font-family: serif;"> Plan </h3>
    <p style ="color: White; position: absolute; top: 930px; left: 265px; font-family: serif; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;"> Currently, I don't have any qualifications apart from a completion of VCE, but possess skills of creativity, openness, and a love for technology. I am also a <br> supportive person, who always seeks for authenticity with relationships.
      However, I am not the best with communication, or have experience in the listed <br> technological/programming processes. Thus, I plan to finish my studies in the bachelor of IT, and then go for an internship/Entry-Level job where I can <br> train specifically in the areas of software development, while also perhaps studying a Masters. Then with the experience gained, I should be able to get a <br> similar position in the industry.
