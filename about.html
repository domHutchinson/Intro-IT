    <!--Going to insert an image here-->
    <h3 style="color: #20ffff; position: absolute; top: 590px; left: 350px; text-align: center; font-family: serif;"> Howdy! I'm Dominic Hutchinson, a 1st year Bachelor of IT student, studying at RMIT Melbourne. </h3>
    <p style ="color: White; position: absolute; top: 650px; left: 265px; font-family: serif; font-size: 18px; text-align: center;">
    My interests include: Technologies, Media, the reading and writing of Books, Casual Gaming (Board Games, Card Games, Video Games, <br> etc.)
    and over-analysing content. I also love quirky, nerdy, and weird stuff that makes you question reality, (usually in the form of memes <br> or interesting books/games)
    or anything which challenges thoughts or perspectives on challenging topics.
    <p style ="color: White; position: absolute; top: 725px; left: 265px; font-family: serif; font-size: 18px; text-align: center;">
  I was born and raised in Australia, (and haven't left the country as of yet!) and just completed VCE studies last year at Kambrya College. <br>
  I am a Christian, apart of Melbourne Lights Church, and can read and understand a decent bit of Chinese (preferring English all the way <br> though.)
  </p>
  <p style ="color: White; position: absolute; top: 800px; left: 265px; font-family: serif; font-size: 18px; text-align: center;">
    My hobbies consist of: reading, writing, watching TV shows and movies, gaming, drawing, and self-learning the keyboard (in that order.)<br>
    And while this isn't a hobby, my family has a fair amount of pets including: 2 dogs, a bunny, a guinea pig and several fish, that all need <br> looking after.
   </p>
   <p style ="color: White; position: absolute; top: 880px; left: 265px; font-family: serif; font-size: 18px; text-align: center;">
   Some things you might not know about me are that: I am an aspiring author, looking to publish soon in the YA-Sci-Fi/Fantasy genre,
   I am <br> (forcibly) a collector of hats, cards and other strange stuff, and that I have High-Functioning ASD which extremifies my senses, limits my <br> people skills, and other weird stuff, which includes my fascination into

  <!-- Test Taken from: NERIS Analytics Limited 2022, 'Free personality test, type descriptions, relationship and career advice', '16Personalities', viewed 07 March 2022, <https://www.16personalities.com> -->
  <h4 style="color: #20ffff; position: absolute; top: 1100px; left: 905px; text-align: center; font-family: serif;"> Myers-Briggs Personality Test: </h4>
  <p style ="color: White; position: absolute; top: 1150px; left: 760px; font-family: serif; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;">According to this 16Personalities test, I am an 'Advocate' which outlines that I <br> am a very thoughtful, curious, imaginative, feeling-orientated, decisive person <br> who is also sensitive to build-up of emotion.
     To me, this clarifies that I am a  <br> 'thinking' kind of person, able to problem solve a issue/come up with ideas <br> and perhaps also give insight on how to do these, but have trouble creating the <br> solution itself.
     Thus, when looking for a group, I should aim to support people <br> who have a more action-orientated mindset, who can create from ideas for the <br> best efficiency. In a group, I'd more than most likely take the role of a problem <br> solver, who can come up with ideas to circumnavigate issues and think things <br> through.
     I would also contribute by testing and thinking of new ways to do <br> things and tasks in the project to help provide the best solution.

  <h4 style="color: #20ffff; position: absolute; top: 1395px; left: 930px; text-align: center; font-family: serif;"> Big 5 Personality Test: </h4>
  <p style ="color: White; position: absolute; top: 1430px; left: 760px; font-family: serif; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;">This test also agrees that I am a thinking, feeling-oriented, introverted person, <br> while also being 'agreeable' and creative with high intellect.
This test also  <br> states that I am careful and dilegent, which are both positive traits to have in <br> group-orientated work, confirming my previous allocation to being a creative <br> problem solver.

  <h4 style="color: #20ffff; position: absolute; top: 1530px; left: 935px; text-align: center; font-family: serif;"> Learning Styles Test: </h4>
  <p style ="color: White; position: absolute; top: 1570px; left: 760px; font-family: serif; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;">This test states that my learning style consists of mainly theoretical/reflective <br> learning, indicating that I solve problems logically and through organisation, <br> while also prefering to stand back and observe, collecting and analysing <br> information, thinking of the big picture.
    Next to these is the pragmatic <br> learning style, where learning and trying out new ideas and theories on the go <br> is a big focus, which only supports the position of a creative problem solver in <br> this case. And last is the Activist style, which indicates that I am less into <br> immersing myself in an experience, but more observe the results of such.
